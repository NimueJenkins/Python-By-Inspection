# Python-By-Inspection
KS3, KS4 and KS5 Python scripts (mostly in Jupyter format)

## Background
As a teacher of 15 years, with an additional 15 years of experience as a back-end web designer and research scientist, I have come to the conclusion that the way we teach computer science (or more specifically, coding) to young people is counter intuitive and often backwards.  We (the educationalists) rely on formal methods as the starting point - *loops, conditionals, variables, string manipulation, input / output....* all good stuff.  But somewhere along the line, we have forgotten that for many of us, this is not the way we learned how to code.

 - We learned how to code because it was interesting
 - We learned how to code because it gave us the sense of creation
 - We learned how to code because it was new, and dare I say it "geeky"
 - We learned how to code because we built on the work of others
 - We learned how to code because puled apart (or hacked) existing programs
 - We learned how to code because it helped us solve problems (even if that problem was how to cheat  - remember POKE 41971,0 to get rid of these pesky Thargons in Elite on the Spectrum 48K?)


Only later did we formalise this approach with an theoretical understanding of the "official" reason behind how / why something worked.  Now, we seem obsessed with teaching these "formal" methods and (IMHO) have managed to suck the fun out of the subject.  All this, whilst we seem obsessed with linking these formal methods to the creation of "games" - from bouncing cats on screen to moving poorly rendered cars round an imaginary racking track.

## Coding is fun
Getting a computer to do your bidding is fun.  Starting with a blank cursor, you spend time working on something to make something happen and then you can bask in the glory of your creation.  

This creation usually starts with solving a problem -- and this is where current computer science pedagogy falls down (again, IMHO).Lower down the school, (say in KS2), we give the problem, we set the learners up, give them some instructions and off they go.  This usually involves copy code or blocks from paper into the computer and suddenly they have "made a game" - the cat can move.  They then tweak the code (hack) to make the cat move faster, to the left and backwards -- all useful stuff.

Then BAM! You're older now, so the best way to learn stuff is "formally" -- 5 different iteration styles - check; boolean algebra - check; variable types - check; string manipulation rules - check; syntax and error handling -- double check.  Suddenly, computer science (coding) goes from fun to a hard core science.

I'm not arguing that CS is not a science - but "coding" can be taught in a less formal and dry manner. Please.

**Python-By-Inspection** is my publicly available, growing selection of annotated Python scripts (mostly in Jupyter notebook format) that can be used by inspection -- i.e. by reading the code, trying to work out what is going on and the tweak stuff to see what happens.  And yes, there will then by suggested "tasks" for personal learning -- but the rub here is that the student will be expected to look stuff up.  

Because my final observation is that we don't often emulate in the classroom one of the most important tools of a computer scientist -- the value of looking stuff up.  Need to know how to join to strings "Google it".  Need to know how to find the first vowel in a sentence in Python? Post it  on Stackoverflow.  Need to know what the most efficient way to iterate over 100000 values? Reach out to Twitter (maybe not, use Stackoverflow. Really.)

## Organisation
The repository is organised into sub folders.  Each sub-folder is a self contained example; Python scripts, annotated PDF and supporting files (if any)
